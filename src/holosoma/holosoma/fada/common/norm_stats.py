"""Validation for the observation/action normalization statistics carried in a checkpoint.

`fada.planner_idm.eval_checkpoint` and `fada.planner_idm.finetune_idm_lora` each read
`obs_norm_stats` / `act_norm_stats` out of a `.pt` payload and feed them to
`(x - mean) / std`. This module is the single point where those checkpoint bytes are
checked, since the values never pass through a CLI flag.

Not rejected:

- `std == 0`. A constant observation dimension has zero variance; `clamp(std, min=eps)`
  handles it.
- Any finite mean, however large.

`std < 0` is rejected: `clamp(std, min=eps)` would turn it into `eps` and rescale that
dimension.
